= Cuckoo

A stupid script that shows a notification every 30 minutes.

Use it to remember to take a break, stand up, stretch your legs, contemplate life and how meaningless your existence is.

== Installation

Clone the repo

Copy the `cuckoo.service` and `cuckoo.timer` files in appropriate places.
Pick something from the paths that `man systemd.unit` lists. I recommend `~/.config/systemd/user/`

`systemctl enable cuckoo.timer` and `systemd start cuckoo.timer` to schedule it

=== for ArchLinux

For archlinux you can just `makepkg -sri` to install it after cloning the repo

== Configuration

The default schedule is every half an hour.

If you'd like it to be something different you'll have to edit the `cuckoo.timer` manually prior to installation.

= TODO

- Making the easily schedule configurable
